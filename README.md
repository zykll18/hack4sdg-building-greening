# Building Greening Decision Support

An IFC-based presentation workspace for building professionals to compare greening plans across roofs, facades, balconies/terraces and ground areas. Architects, BIM coordinators and sustainability designers prepare regions and scenarios; developers or building owners review the results.

## Presentation flow

1. Run `npm ci` and `npm run dev`, then open `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` (Node 20.19+ or 22.12+). The KIT office architectural example opens as a full-viewport interactive model.
2. Location screening runs after loading. Blue highlights mark a conditional starting set. **Click the building itself** to toggle eligible locations green; earlier selections stay highlighted when clicking another component or blank space. Incompatible windows/floors are not added. Inspect stays closed while selecting. Open **Inspect** to review only the selected locations, edit each usable area and read missing checks; **Use recommended locations** adds the suggested set while retaining other choices. Acknowledge the reviewed set, then **Add selected regions to both plans** and **Compare combined plans**. Optional **Custom strip or courtyard** provides detailed cropping and manually defined ground regions. Ordinary floors cannot be treated as terraces.
3. Click **Review region surface**, verify/edit the usable area within the extracted surface and acknowledge exterior/available space and unresolved professional checks, then confirm its type/area. Click **Add region to both plans**.
4. For **Ground / courtyard**, set rectangle dimensions and offsets before reviewing/confirming. The rectangle must stay outside the conservative building bounding footprint. Confirm ground level, available land and utilities. It is user-defined design geometry, not an IFC site/ownership boundary.
5. Open **Compare**, switch **Light-touch** / **Landscape mix**, and use **Before / After** on the model. Both plans use the same confirmed regions. Region removal updates both plans.
6. In **Project**, edit the comparison period/budget or load another model. Replacement clears old regions and overlays.
7. Download the HTML comparison report and JSON handoff. They retain current model/IFC identities, areas, systems, factors, checks and results for team integration.

**Voice interaction stays in Inspect.** Expand **Voice input & questions**, choose Cantonese/Mandarin/English, start recording and review/edit the transcript. Choose **Ask about locations** to run the same screening, or type directly. Nothing is added automatically. Microphone access and language support depend on the browser; speech audio may be processed by its speech service. There is no separate Assist panel and no AI model connection yet.

A/B/C/D presentation responsibilities and browser acceptance are in [TEAM_TASKS.md](TEAM_TASKS.md); implementation and provenance boundaries are in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Verification

`npm test` runs deterministic calculation, identity, whole-set confirmation without partial mutation, four-region aggregation, edge clipping, continuous visual coverage area and compatibility screening checks. `npm run build` produces the browser build. `node scripts/check-greening.mjs` checks original KIT office candidate screening, then separately exercises synthetic four-region geometry extraction, coverage and plan calculation without claiming browser or spatial suitability validation. `npm run test:ifc -- /path/to/file.ifc` verifies parser/conversion identities.

## Evidence boundaries

Current costs/carbon factors are explicitly labelled presentation assumptions. Display mesh areas assume renderer units are metres and require user confirmation; confirmed area is not professional engineering approval. The comparison covers proposed interventions only, excludes plant carbon sequestration, and does not establish whole-building emissions or net-zero status. Structural loading, waterproofing, drainage, facade fixings, access/fire strategy, irrigation and land/utility availability remain unresolved checks.

Scenario profiles are structured rules. No external AI service, government incentive approval, certification or marketplace transaction is claimed. Local IFC files are processed in the browser.

## Architectural samples and licensing

Project offers original KIT office/house IFC designs (explicitly fictional), the documented Schependomlaan residential design model, official That Open school architecture Fragments/structural IFC and the compact buildingSMART test house. Source links, byte hashes, license notices and local geometry previews are in `public/samples/README.md`. Schependomlaan's byte-identical original IFC is restored from the bundled lossless gzip by the asset-preparation script; its 49.3 MB conversion may take longer.

The viewer reuses [That Open Components](https://github.com/ThatOpen/engine_components). [xeokit-bim-viewer](https://github.com/xeokit/xeokit-bim-viewer) supplies UI inspiration only. No xeokit implementation is included.
